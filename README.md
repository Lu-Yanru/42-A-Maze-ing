# A-Maze-ing
42 project that creates a reusable maze generator based on a configuration file.

## Description

## Instruction

## Project management

### Todos
- README (each write own stuff)
- Makefile
- Read configuration file and check validity (lucas)
- Generate maze
	- x Grid representation (yanru)
		- x Terminal output for testing
	    - x Fixed 42 pattern and config checking
            - x generate 42 pattern
            - x check grid is big enough
            - x check entry and exit points are not in 42 pattern
	- Perfect algo1 -> Backtracking (lucas)
	- x Perfect algo2 -> Prim (yanru)
    - Imperfect maze: randomly remove walls if not form a bigger corridor
- Find shortest path -> Breadth First Search?
- Write to output file (yanru)
    - x Write maze to output
    - x Write entry and exit points
    - Write solution
- Visualization
    - ascii (lucas)
- Make reuable module
