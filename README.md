# A-Maze-ing
42 project that creates a reusable maze generator based on a configuration file.

## Description

## Instruction

## Project management

### Todos
- README (each write own stuff)
- Makefile
- Read configuration file and check validity
- Generate maze
	- Grid representation
		- Terminal output for testing
	- Fixed 42 pattern and config checking
	- Perfect algo -> Backtracking?
	- Imperfect algo -> Prim?
- Find shortest path -> Breadth First Search?
- Write to output file
- Visualization (MLX)
- Make reuable module
